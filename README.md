# 3D Image Processing and Analysis Pipeline (Cellpose version)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3f1c21-825f-4c91-abda-081dcaa4e244

This repository contains the Cellpose version of the [3D Image Processing and Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/jlhor/3d-imaging-pipeline).

We strongly recommend that you create a new Conda environment separate from the original Stardist environment to minimize dependencies incompatibility. Additionally, as the parallelization aspect of the Cellpose workflow is distinct from the Stardist workflow, both segmentation and data extraction steps are self-contained and should be run separately from the original workflow.

Please follow the [Cellpose Guide](doc/cellpose.md) for complete instructions.
